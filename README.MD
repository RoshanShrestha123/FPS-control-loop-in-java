### Description
This code is for the student/programmer who are looking to build game or simuation 
in java.
I have provided just the enough foundation to get you started on the simuation/games.

This is the FPS controlled env, where each loop is triggred every 60 FPS(default)
Make you own changes going forward.

Would loved to see what you guys make out of it.
